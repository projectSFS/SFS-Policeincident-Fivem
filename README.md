This script is for a command called "police incident" 
that can be used by police officers in a game.
When the command is executed by a police officer, 
it prompts them to enter a reason for the incident.
The entered reason is then sent to a Discord channel through a webhook.![d47ed0628ecbcae63367d49877dd493ea55bc74b_2_690x388](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/130466738/231284031-3fa4582f-21a1-473a-9b1c-dd53ec53b3b4.jpg)
